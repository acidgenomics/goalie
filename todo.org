* Development
** TODO Need `isFormula` check.
** TODO isEmpty masks some Bioconductor functions.
** TODO Note that `NULL` arguments aren't passing through as expected with `matchArgsToDoCall()`. Look into fixing this in a future goalie release.
    For example, `color = NULL` doesn't pass as expected.
** TODO skip_on_ci utility.
** TODO isInstalled.
** TODO isNonEmpty("") returns TRUE.
