## goalie 0.2.3 (2019-01-04)

- Reorganized base engine function files, getting rid of the `base-` prefix.
- Added conditional `NULL` support where applicable, with `nullOK` formal.
  Applies to `isInt()`, `isNumber()`, `isString()`, for example.
- Migrated some low-level functions from [basejump][] that are useful for
  assertive checks: `matchArgsToDoCall()`, `standardizeCall()`, and the
  `MethodDefinition` family, which includes `methodFunction()`,
  `methodFormals()`, `hasLocal()`, `extractLocal()`. These will get re-exported
  in [basejump][].
- General documentation improvements.


## goalie 0.2.2 (2018-12-12)

- `assert()`: Added `msg` formal. Improved error message when a user inputs
  check functions that don't return boolean.
- `capitalize()`: Simplified documentation, referring the user to the
  documentation provided in [syntactic][] package.
- `falseFromVector()`: Newly exported function.
- `isInRange` family: Added scalar variants for all vectorized functions.
- Improved scalar return consistency in functions where applicable, using
  `falseFromVector()` internally.


## goalie 0.2.1 (2018-12-20)

- The approach to the package update is heavily influenced by the conventions
  defined in the assertive package. In goalie, I'm attempting to create a
  minimal assert check engine that behaves similar to `stopifnot()`, but with
  more informative error messages. This approach is inspired by the assertthat
  package, but neither assertive or assertthat are working quite right for my
  needs.
- Overhauled the `assert()` and `validate()` engines, re-writing the code from
  scratch based on the internal code of `stopifnot()`.
- Reworked all assertive check functions to reduce the number of dependencies.
  Now the package is lean and mean, only importing methods and utils into the
  NAMESPACE.
- Assertive checks now return as `goalie` class in addition to `logical`.


## goalie 0.2.0 (2018-12-12)

- Removed all `assert*()` functions in favor of a simpler, assertthat style
  approach using `assert()` for all checks. The package will export check
  functions that return `logical`, typically `logical(1)` (boolean flag) for
  most checks. These checks can then be wrapped in `assert()` or `validate()`
  (for S4 class validity checks) calls.


## goalie 0.1.2 (2018-11-21)

- `isDir()` and `isFile()` now import `R.utils::isDirectory()` and
  `R.utils::isFile()`.


## goalie 0.1.1 (2018-11-14)

- `areUniqueGeneNames()` now returns `boolean` as expected.
- Improved error message for `assertAreUniqueGeneNames()`.


## goalie 0.1.0 (2018-11-11)

- Initial release, migrating assertive check functions from [basejump][]
  package.
